# Simple-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategy

This project shows the simple algorithmic trading strategy that uses moving averages to generate buy and sell signals. This algorithmic trading strategy is simple and can be easily implemented using a programming language like Python and an API to access stock market data. 

This algorithmic trading strategy is based on the following principles:

1) Use a simple moving average (SMA) to determine the trend of a stock.

2) Buy the stock when the price crosses above the SMA, indicating an uptrend.

3) Sell the stock when the price crosses below the SMA, indicating a downtrend.

4) Use a stop loss to limit potential losses.
